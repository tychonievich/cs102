	Both intractable and undecideable problems are hard:
	
	A. Intractable cannot be solved at all; 	Undecideable cannot be solved at all
	B. Intractable cannot be solved at all; 	Undecideable take too long to solve
	C. Intractable take too long to solve; 	Undecideable cannot be solved at all
	D. Intractable take too long to solve; 	Undecideable take too long to solve


	Both intractable and undecideable problems are characterized by broad scope:
	
	A. Intractable accept themselves as input; 	Undecideable accept themselves as input
	B. Intractable accept themselves as input; 	Undecideable look for "the best" option
	C. Intractable look for "the best" option; 	Undecideable accept themselves as input
	D. Intractable look for "the best" option; 	Undecideable look for "the best" option


	To work around an undecidable problem
	
	A. Use a heuristic
	B. Try limiting the problem space
	C. Accept a program that sometimes says "I don't know"
	D. Wait for Moore's Law to give us faster computers
	E. Give up, this can't be done
