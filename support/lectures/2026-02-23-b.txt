	Pick some property X of a program (e.g. "doesn't crash", "requires authentication", "computes x²", ...)



	Assume we have a program M
		input: another program
		output: whether that program "does X" or not



	Paradox:
		if M(Paradox) is "yes, it does X",
			don't do X
		otherwise,
			do X


	Ergo, checking any functional property of programs is undecideable (Rice's Theorem)
